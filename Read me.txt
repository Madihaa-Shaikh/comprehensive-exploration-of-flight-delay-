Read Flight data
Print all features 
The goal is to reduce the cost of flight delay. Which target feature do we choose and why?
How can we determine how strong is the influence of WEATHER_DELAY on ARR_DELAY?
Delete ARR_DELAY and String data
Set thetargetofa delay>15 minutesto1 otherwise to 0,
How linear correlated are the features to the target?
What are the requirements of Linear Regression?
Test Normal Distribution (with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) of the feature ARR_DELAY (use only the 100 data sets) and print the histogram
Perform a nonlinear transformation of the values and check again for normal distribution
Use a decision tree for prediction.
Printmean squared error and R2 score.
To compare different models create a dictionary of the models · LinearRegression · Decision Tree · MLP (MLPRegressor)

Use for the classification of the flight delay Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting
Compare the classification methods using AUC, Recall, F1 score
